# Driverless AI Deployment Examples

This repository contains different examples for deploying Driverless AI (DAI) scorers.

The goal of the examples in this repo is to easily convey the necessary steps.

To this end, we aim to have the examples:
 - self-contained
 - simple

In production deployments, the following points should be considered:
 - test coverage
 - code reuse
 - error handling
 - monitoring

In other words, here we prioritize didactic value over production readiness.
